Console Snake Game made in C# including menu where user can adjust settings of the game
Made for educational purpose and fun

Main purpose is was to enhance Object Oriented programming principles.
The code is far from perfect and there are a lot of things to improve from design view. However at moment of finishing this (29/1/2025) I want to focus on other things, but will most likely get back to this later.

Main issues:
1. Repository wasnt properly setup
1. Whole game is run from Main menu
2. Snake is not getting faster over time - not hard to implement, just did not figure out nice algorithm to gradually increase speed which would work over longer time
